# Sequence- ordering of expresions in your program
# Selection - making choices like if/else
# Iteration - loops
# All programing language have the 3 main control flow and with those you can write any algorithm.

    num =  eval(input('Enter a number: '))
    print('The square of your number is ', num + num)
print('The loop is done!')
